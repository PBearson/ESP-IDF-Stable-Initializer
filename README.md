### ESP-IDF Stable Initializer

Set up ESP-IDF for your workspace. Simply run "bash setup.sh" to install everything. The default install location is "$HOME/esp", but this can be changed in the script. 

The script works successfully on 64-bit architectures and Debian/Ubuntu distributions. Support for other environments may come later.
